Overall Form situation:

- App checks if the Customer has a JWT upon visiting site
  - If they do, sets them as logged in
    ~ Upon visiting the Stylist Reservation page, the app runs loading in the customer info area while checking and fetching info
    - Uses their name as a welcome in the Form
    \ If they have JWT but no User data, fetch user data on reservation page
  - If they don't, it show Login and Register Buttons
    - Pop up Modals for this
      - Once good response is recieved, redirect to Stylist Reservation page to run checks again

- Create Login and Register buttons in Form
- Create Showing modals based from them
- Create individual modals for Login and Register
- Create forms for Register and check for proper data being entered
- Copy over the same for Login 

- Test Backend for all routes
  - Use tenative Date data for appointment

- Create User context and save JWT and User data to cookies
  ~ Figure out cookies... stil haven't 

- Invoke context into Stylist Reservation page to check if user is logged in
  - If logged in, show Welcome message
  - If not logged in, show buttons 

- Create a grid, graph, table for the schedule? Needs to be able to take in set date and keep track of that... look into a calender guide? Just need to alter it for use on a day/30min-hour schedule system 

- Create comment section and Reservation Button 

- Create Confirmation Page that times out to return User to HomePage
