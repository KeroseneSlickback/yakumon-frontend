Overall Form situation:

- Create a grid, graph, table for the schedule? Needs to be able to take in set date and keep track of that... look into a calender guide? Just need to alter it for use on a day/30min-hour schedule system 

- Create Confirmation Page that times out to return User to HomePage

Need to create a grid with times, dates, buttons to shift to previous week and next week, and then each time slot is selectable. 

- Figure out what data is needed to be mapped
- Mapped? Or looped through twice to create an array?
- Then how to output it all
