Overall Form situation:

- Create a grid, graph, table for the schedule? Needs to be able to take in set date and keep track of that... look into a calender guide? Just need to alter it for use on a day/30min-hour schedule system 

- Create Confirmation Page that times out to return User to HomePage

Need to create a grid with times, dates, buttons to shift to previous week and next week, and then each time slot is selectable. 

First, sort out React-router-dom new system.
- Work out fetching store data on Home
  - Fetch and display this data on Home section 
  - Make it selectable and navigatable to the store page 
  

- Add comments onto appointment (from textarea)
