Overall Form situation:

- Create a grid, graph, table for the schedule? Needs to be able to take in set date and keep track of that... look into a calender guide? Just need to alter it for use on a day/30min-hour schedule system 

- Create Confirmation Page that times out to return User to HomePage

Need to create a grid with times, dates, buttons to shift to previous week and next week, and then each time slot is selectable. 

- Figure out what data is needed to be mapped
- Mapped? Or looped through twice to create an array?
- Then how to output it all
- 30min sections

Schedule Array Maker:
- Given a set start date and Store open+close time, it creates a nested array
  - exampleOutput = [
      (Date for 4/9): [
        {(date for 4/9 9am), avail: true/false, applicable: true/false},
        (date for 4/9 10am),
        (date for 4/9 11am),
        (date for 4/9 12pm),
        (date for 4/9 1pm),
        (date for 4/9 2pm),
      ],
      (Date for 4/10): [
        (date for 4/10 9am),
        (date for 4/10 10am),
        (date for 4/10 11am),
        (date for 4/10 12pm),
        (date for 4/10 1pm),
        (date for 4/10 2pm),
      ]
    ]
- Send above array to a Schedule Appointment Filler
  - Given the array and the employee's appointments, fills in if the slot is available

- ScheduleView highlights the slots that are available,
  - And when a service is selected, runs a Find Applicable Time Slots to sort through the array and highlight specific slots that match the given service 

- When a user selects either applicable time slots, a User Selected Slot function runs to find the earliest timeslot
- When the user submits the form, the info is sent to the backend, loading, and return of either an error message or a confimation modal pop-up before being redirected
