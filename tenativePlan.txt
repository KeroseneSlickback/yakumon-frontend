Overall Form situation:

- Create a grid, graph, table for the schedule? Needs to be able to take in set date and keep track of that... look into a calender guide? Just need to alter it for use on a day/30min-hour schedule system 

- Create Confirmation Page that times out to return User to HomePage

Need to create a grid with times, dates, buttons to shift to previous week and next week, and then each time slot is selectable. 

- Figure out what data is needed to be mapped
- Mapped? Or looped through twice to create an array?
- Then how to output it all
- 30min sections

- ScheduleView highlights the slots that are available,
  - And when a service is selected, runs a Find Applicable Time Slots to sort through the array and highlight specific slots that match the given service 

- When a user selects either applicable time slots, a User Selected Slot function runs to find the earliest timeslot
- When the user submits the form, the info is sent to the backend, loading, and return of either an error message or a confimation modal pop-up before being redirected 


- Once properly prepared, how to go about altering the object and then returning the new string?
