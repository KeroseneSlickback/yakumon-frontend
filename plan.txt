I need to focus on first stage operations.
They would be:

  - Direct portal to the shop's Yakumon page (react-router-dom)
  - On that page, display store infomation (entered from owner)
    - Store image
    - Store description
    - Business hours
    - Business location
    - Available stylists to select from--if one only, default to "Make a reservation"
  - Selected stylist's available operations and pricing.
    - User enters their name and phone number as contacts
    - Upon selecting stylist, the grayed out schedule selection is focused on and cleared
      - Schedule output:
        - The selected opertation takes in account time nessacary to perform
        - Schedule by default shows reserved time, stylist's selected "off" times, and available times
        - Schedule highlights times when the chosen operations can be selected 
        - Mobile view: Shows three days of schedule
        - >XXXpx shows 5 days
        - Has next arrow to show next week, up until one month in advance
      - Once chosen, a comment section opens up
      - Submit button is cleared as well, good to submit 
      - Upon submit, loading and then redirect to confirmation page with reservation summary or error warning

  - Owner side:
    - Specific Owner/Operator area at bottom of page
    - Upon click, brought into either application for own page or Login area 
    - Owner form: 
      - Business name
      - Business photo upload
      - Business description
      - Business days and hours of operation 
      - Owner's name (if JP, kana input too)
      - Phone number
      - Email address
      - Password and password confirmation
    - Upon login: 
      - Brought to Owner frontpage where they oversee the schedule for the week
      - Owner to alter their schedule two months in advance from here
      - Schedule automatically sets unavaiable blocks from the store business hours
        - Upon clicking "New" button, owner can create Reservation and Block 
      - Upon clicking a reservation, a module pops up with details 
        - Reservation name
        - Phone number 
        - Stylist
        - Operation
        - Time slot 
        - Comments 
        - Edit and Delete buttons 
          - Delete has a confirmation module pop up 
          - Edit brings up a module using the customer-facing schedule system
            - Owner to move reservation to a different available time (dummy mode, only available time allowed)
      - Owner can logout (dummy infinity mode for now)


- Bilingual JP/EN (make in English, have context created for switch, and later change to Japanese)
